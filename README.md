## Prerequisites

- node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- gulp (`npm install gulp`)

## Installation

Download the dependencies using `npm install`, and create the build directory and launch a local server with `gulp`. That's it!

A new tab should open in your browser directed at localhost:3000, or you can navigate there manually. If you decide to manipulate content in this repo--to swap in your personal view IDs for example--gulp will build and load your changes automatically.
