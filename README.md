# Reflect Examples

**ReflectDocs**: https://reflect.io/docs/

**Note**: To test and manipulate this examples set please follow the guide below. To download themes for your personal application, please visit https://github.com/reflect/examples/blob/master/apps/themes/

## Prerequisites

- node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- gulp (`npm install gulp`)

## Installation

Download the dependencies using `npm install` and create the build directory and launch a local server with `gulp`. That's it!

A new tab should open in your browser directed at localhost:3000, or you can navigate there manually. If you decide to manipulate content in this repo--to swap in your personal view IDs for example--gulp will build and load your changes automatically.

## Custom themes

We are excited announce that custom theming will be made available in the coming months. In the meantime, this repo provides several variants of our default theme for you to clone as you please.
